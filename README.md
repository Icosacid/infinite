## Features

While following the design guidelines, the prototype uses some UX features as well as light back-end functionalities.

Asynchronous calls load content from a JSON file. Underscore.js templating facilities are used to format raw data and inject it into the DOM for repeated sections.

Bootstrap grid layout is used. A responsive behavior is ensured for the upper parts, i.e. header and banner sections.

Some parallax effects were implemented for top and mid-page banners.

## Future developments

In case of more JS and a full website content management system, light frameworks such as Vue.js should be used. On a wider scale, Angular.js or Backbone.js, or CMS would be relevant.

Loading the JSON content should be done via an external service such as Firebase.js (https://firebase.google.com/)

More creativity is of course welcome, with more time to dedicate to the project.
