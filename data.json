    "news_intro_text": "Algorithmic art, also known as computer_generated art, is a subset of generative art (generated by an autonomous system) and is related to systems art (influenced by systems theory). Fractal art is an example of algorithmic art.",
    "news_content_text": "For an image of reasonable size, even the simplest algorithms require too much calculation for manual execution to be practical, and they are thus executed on either a single computer or on a cluster of computers. The final output is typically displayed on a computer monitor, printed with a raster_type printer, or drawn using a plotter. Variability can be introduced by using pseudo_random numbers. There is no consensus as to whether the product of an algorithm that operates on an existing image (or on any input other than pseudo_random numbers) can still be considered computer_generated art, as opposed to computer_assisted art."
